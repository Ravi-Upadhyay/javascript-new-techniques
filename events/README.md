## What is events<a name="event"></a>

This is very common use case in web development that we want our software/web application to respond to user. Web applications are meant to be interactive. Interactive means responding to the actions of user has taken on your web application.

We have events, Elements in HTML may have events and we can catch those events in Javascript and do something. 

Simple example, Greet user when he clicks on button element.
