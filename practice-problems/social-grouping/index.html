<h2>Social-Groups</h2>
<h4>Make social groups, given a matrix representing friendship of two individuals.</h4>

<p>
  <span>PROBLEM STATEMENT: </span>
  We have one matrix M of order (m x n), if we have 1 in
  matrix corresponding to (m,n) then m and n are friends. if we have 0 in 
  matrix corresponding to (m,n) then m and n are not friends. We have to 
  make groups out of it in which all people who are direct friends and 
  indirect friends will be in same group.
